# Customer_churn
A customer churn prediction model using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and to predict the churn and use precision, recall, f1-score to measure performance of the model
INTRODUCTION:
Customer churn is simply the rate at which customers leave doing business with an
entity. Simply put, churn prediction involves determining the possibility of customers
stopping doing business with an entity. In other words, if a consumer has purchased a
subscription to a particular service, we must determine the likelihood that the
customer would leave or cancel the membership.
It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often
costs more than retaining existing ones. Customer churn measures how and why are
customers leaving the business.
# Why it is important to predict customer churn?
Retaining existing customers is less expensive than to acquire new customers.
Moreover, the revenue from repeat customers is usually higher than from new
customers. In a competitive industry, where there is plenty of competitors, the cost for
customer acquisition could be even higher. That is why predicting customer churn
becomes so vital for businesses to be able to retain them before they decide to leave.

# DATASET INFORMATION:
I have used telecom customer churn dataset from Kaggle and built a deep learning
model for churn prediction. The Telco customer churn data contains information
about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to
7043 customers in California. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed
up for their service.
